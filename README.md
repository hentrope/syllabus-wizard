Syllabus Wizard is a web application developed using Python and Google App Engine. It was created for a software engineering course during the Fall 2015 semester.

## Demonstration
The app is live at [syllabus-wizard.appspot.com](https://syllabus-wizard.appspot.com/) with only minor modifications since its completion in 2015.

In order to use the app, you will need to log in to the admin account (username="admin", password="password") and create a new account to work with. Log out, and log back in with the new account, and you will be able to create a syllabus. Note that any instructor information needs to be added under the Profile/Instructors tabs at the top.

## Objective
Our task was to create an application that could be used by professors to easily generate course syllabi. In particular, the application would need to provide a feature that could scrape the university website and automatically fill in as much information for a course as possible. Furthermore, the application needed a feature that would allow a professor to duplicate an old syllabus for reuse in following semesters.

This application accomplishes both of these tasks, and also features a profile system that allows for professors and TAs to be reused across multiple syllabi, reducing the risk of inconsistent information.
